# Global-AQI-Analysis-PowerBI

📌 Project Overview

The Global AQI Analysis Dashboard is an interactive Power BI project designed to analyze and visualize air quality levels across different countries and regions. The dashboard enables geographical comparison of AQI values and provides pollutant-wise analysis to understand the contribution of major air pollutants to overall air quality.

🎯 Objective

To present global air quality data in a clear and interactive format, allowing users to compare AQI levels across countries and regions and analyze pollutant-wise variations for better understanding of air pollution patterns.
